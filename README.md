# Mess Management System - Software Requirements Specification

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents for a **Mess Management System** designed for GIKI (Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute). The project aims to digitize and streamline mess operations by replacing the traditional manual register system with an automated digital platform.

### 🎯 Purpose

The Mess Management System addresses critical inefficiencies in the current manual mess management process, including:
- **Attendance Errors**: Manual register entries lead to frequent mistakes in mess-in/mess-out tracking
- **Billing Inaccuracies**: Time-consuming manual bill calculations prone to human error
- **Payment Inconvenience**: Manual payment processes requiring physical bank visits
- **Limited Transparency**: No real-time access to attendance history or billing details
- **Poor Communication**: Lack of automated notifications and feedback mechanisms

### ✨ Key Features

The proposed system includes the following core functionalities:

1. **Digital Mess In/Out System**
   - Automated attendance tracking
   - Real-time status updates
   - Biometric/ID card authentication options

2. **Automated Billing & Payments**
   - Real-time bill calculations
   - Online payment integration
   - Billing history access
   - Fine handling for missed deadlines

3. **Notifications & Alerts**
   - Mess-in/out deadline reminders
   - Bill due date notifications
   - Meal cutoff alerts

4. **Feedback & Complaint System**
   - Structured complaint submission
   - Anonymous feedback option
   - Quality and service issue reporting

5. **Management Dashboard**
   - Attendance tracking and reporting
   - Cost calculation and forecasting
   - Inventory management support
   - Meal count forecasting

6. **Security & Access Control**
   - Role-based access (Students, Staff, Supervisor, Admin)
   - Secure authentication
   - Data encryption (AES-256)
   - Audit logs
